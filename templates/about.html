          Hi, I'm Rahul Jaiswar, a dedicated and detail-oriented data analyst
          with a strong background in statistical analysis, data visualization,
          and machine learning. I have a passion for uncovering insights from
          data and using them to drive business decisions. With a solid
          foundation in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I am skilled at
          transforming complex data into actionable insights.

          professional experience includes working on projects involving data
          cleaning, analysis, and visualization, such as EDA on Diwali and
